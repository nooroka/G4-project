The project is dedicated to calculating the density in G-quadruplex and interquadruplex regions. <br>
In "Peaks" folder  there  peaks-extracting are quadruplex-making scripts (python scripts and Snakemake), in "Density" folder we calculate control regions and then compare mutational density. <br>
Mutations are from COSMIC and dbSNP, they are calculated for plus and minus strands. <br>
The data were taken from <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE110582">GSE110582</a> (samples GSM3003539 and GSM3003540, e.g. with or withut PDS).<br>
