The project is dedicated to calculating the density in G-quadruplex and interquadruplex regions. <br>
In "Peaks" folder  there  peaks-extracting are quadruplex-making scripts (python scripts and Snakemake), in "Density" folder we calculate control regions and then compare mutational density. <br>
Mutations are from COSMIC and dbSNP, they are calculated for plus and minus strands. <br>
The data was taken from <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE110582">GSE110582</a> (samples GSM3003539 and GSM3003540, e.g. human HEK-293T cell line 
with or withut PDS).<br>
"39" or "40" in the script means this file is for GSM3003539  or for GSM3003540 <br>.
